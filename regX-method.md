# Matching an Email

I have developed a tutorial that briefly explains how a regular expression, Regex, work. In this tutorial we are going to be looking at matching an Email.

## Summary

For this walk through tutorial we are going to be looking at this example below:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

This expression is used to validate the structure of an email address. One or two lines of code can handle a wide variety of parameters and can easily be tweaked as needed.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

All regular expressions share the same starting `^` and ending `$` anchor of a string. There are other achors that can be used provided below:

* `^` By default and in multiline mode, the match must occur at the beginning of the line or string.
    * `\A` Is also used as a starting anchor for a string but it can't support multi line mode.

* `$` By default and in multiline mode, the match must occur at the end of the line/string or before `\n` in a line/string.
    * `\Z` Is also used at the end of a string or before `\n` at the end of the string but ignores multi line option.
    * `\z` The match must occur at the end of the string **ONLY**. Unlike `\Z` and `$` this doesn't match `\n` at the end of a string.

Word Boundary `\b` and Non-word Boundary `\B`:

* `\b`: The match has to occur on a boundary between a word character and a non-word character. (Word characters consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores)
* `\B` This is the opposite of the `\b` anchor, it specifies that the match must not occur on a word boundary.

The ones used for this expression are `^` start and `$` end.

### Quantifiers

There are four types of quantifiers `+, *, ? and {n}`. For the sample expression used in this tutorial we only use `+ and {n}`:

* `{n}` This is the simplest quantifier, it's a number in a curly brace. Quantifiers are appended to characters to specify how many are needed.
    * For this Regex we use `{2,6}` this means that we are looking for a sequence of characters that are 2 characters long but not longer than 6.

* `+` Has at least one match with the preceding item "x".
    * In our expression `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)` we use the `+` quantifier to match a character that is between `a to z` and/or a number `0 to âˆž` used in the first part of an email before the "@".
    * The same applies for `([\da-z\.-]+)` part that comes after the "@" e.g.: `...@gmail`.
